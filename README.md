The project I developed using ASP.NET Core 7.0 uses MVC architecture. Entity Framework Code First was used for dynamic database management. The DTO layer subjects entities to more secure transactions. The N-Layer architectural structure was implemented in the project, giving priority to making the code more modular and sustainable.
